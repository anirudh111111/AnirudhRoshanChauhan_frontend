Based on the code below answer the following queries:

Q1. Explain what the simple List component does.
Q2. What problems / warnings are there with code?


A1. 
A2.  A few issues or warnings exist with the code:

1. The 'onClickHandler' parameter is incorrectly declared in the PropTypes validation for the 'SingleListItem' component. 'PropTypes.func' should be used instead.

2. The 'PropTypes.array' method in the 'WrappedListComponent' component should be 'PropTypes.arrayOf'. An array of objects should be validated using the syntax "PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape(...))".

3. The 'items' attribute in the 'WrappedListComponent' component defaults to 'null,' however the '.map()' function will not operate on a 'null' value. Instead, it ought to be set to an empty array.

4. The 'onClick' event handler in the 'SingleListItem' component is incorrectly defined. To stop it from being called right away on render, it should be enclosed in an arrow function. 'onClick='() => onClickHandler(index)', for instance.
